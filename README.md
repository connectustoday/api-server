# ConnectUS Backend API Server

This is the web application for ConnectUS. It is written in TypeScript for NodeJS.

## Running (Dev)
The server software has only been tested on GNU/Linux.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/connectustoday/api-server.git
$ cd api-server
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
For development, you should run api-server with `npm start`, as it will call ts-node to automatically compile and run the TypeScript code on the fly.

## Running (Production)
Todo.
